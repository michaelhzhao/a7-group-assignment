<!--
For this assignment, your team will create a simple report of the data collected by the survey everyone took before the course started (names have been removed). The report must include:

    A paragraph of summary information, citing at least 3 values calculated from the data.
    Two charts that display information from the survey (what you visualize is up to you)

Unlike other assignments, you'll keep your code organized in multiple different files. This helps keep your project more modular and clear. You'll create four different files for this project:

    An index.Rmd file that renders your report
    A file with functions that calculate summary information to be included in your report
    A file with a function that returns your first chart
    A file with another function that returns another chart
